        <h2>Mern stack</h2>
       
        <p>The Mern stack and the MEAN stack are both collections of popular JavaScript-based technologies used for web development. MEAN is an equivalent set of tools to MERN, simply replacing the React library and framework with another popular framework called Angular, also known as Angular.js. Both Angular and React are front-end technologies; the rest of the components stay the same.

            Both stacks have strengths and weaknesses. The best choice for your application will depend on your specific needs and preferences.
            
            Key Takeaways
            
            The MERN stack is an open sourceâ€“centric collection of technologies that uses JavaScript for both the browser and server sides of a web application.
            MERN is an acronym for the four technologies that form the stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
            Developers recognize the MERN stack as a simplified development platform for building highly scalable and interactive web applications.</p>
