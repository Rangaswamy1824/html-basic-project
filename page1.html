        <h2>Exploring Our Solar System information...!!</h2>
        <p>The solar system is a fascinating place, filled with a diverse range of celestial bodies. It consists of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, and other objects like asteroids and comets.</p>
        <p>Our journey through the solar system begins with the Sun, the central star around which everything orbits. The eight planets, in order from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has its own unique characteristics and moons.</p>
        <p>Explore more about each planet and the other celestial objects in our solar system!
            The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. Around 75–90 astronomical units from the Sun,[g] the solar wind is halted, resulting in the heliopause. This is the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. The outermost region of the Solar System is the theorized Oort cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius of 2,000–200,000 AU. The closest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000 AU) away. Both stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy.
